# HttpServer

This is a small HttpServer that is reading files and answering requests.
The project is done for an assignment at HÃ¸yskolen Kristiania.

Start the server by running the main method in httpServer ->
Type localhost:8080/index.html in your URL. You could also do the previous and run the program by using the debugger as well as write the command: java -jar target/httpserver-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar in your terminal or commandline.
After starting the server you can navigate between the different files by editing the URL from localhost:8080/index.html to see a plain.txt at localhost:8080/plain.txt, or even show the stylesheet by writing localhost:8080/style.css.
