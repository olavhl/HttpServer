# HttpServer

This is a small HttpServer that is reading files and answering requests.
The project is done for our examn at HÃ¸yskolen Kristiania.

To start of the project you need to implement your own file called pgr203.properties with this structure:
dataSource.url= ...
dataSource.username= ...
dataSource.password= ...

Use your own database, username and password to use this program.

Start the server by running the main method in httpServer ->
Type localhost:8080/index.html in your URL, or click the link that appears in your console. You could also do the previous and run the program by using the debugger as well as write the command: java -jar target/httpserver-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar in your terminal or commandline.

When you launch the program you will be able to add and display members. You can also add projects, assign projectstatus and add members to your project.
There is also a function to change status of a project. If you'd like to you can filter your projects according to member and status.

### Design
The project doesnt have a great interface, but it is very intuitive.

### Experiences
The prosess of this project has been extremly educational. Neither of us had experience with backend development, but it has been a good experience and we have learned so much from it. We've stumbled a lot along the road, a lot of frustration with maven and flyway (migration), but now we think we understand most of the concepts. All in all we are happy with the result and we've increased our knownledge about client-server communication.

## Group evaluation
We have implemented all the basic functionality and want it to be a part of the evaluation.
Our project has consistent code, names, and follow standard Java-conventions. The project is set up with maven and it is possible to run the jar-file.


In addition:
* Handling request target "/"
* Edit status of project
* UML-diagram
* URL-decoding for Norwegian letters
* Video of pairprogramming
* Automatic reports for our tests in Github Actions
* Good use of DAO pattern and Controller pattern.
* Favicon.ico
